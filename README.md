# Simple OCR for manga
# Description
A simple program to extract the text of a vignette or text balloon from a manga panel.
Note: The images must already be saved in a folder to select them according to their corresponding path.

# You may ask “What is this?”
This is a simple program that I developed in python as a practice to measure my knowledge.
As I am just starting in this world, it gives me great joy to share this little project to you.
It may be missing a lot of things and features, but this is a start for me.
I hope you like it and that it works for your manga translations :)

# Executable
Executable for Windows and Linux, works for both systems.
